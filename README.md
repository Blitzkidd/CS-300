# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problems I was solving througout this course were to do with lists and items working in code to display correctly.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I first studied how to create code for them and looked at some examples that were available to see how they had created their codes. I felt doing this helped my understanding in developing code for these types of scenarios as this has become something new to me in this field.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I looked at other examples and other people's works to see how they accomplished their goals.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I feel this project helped me with working on list functionality for various different projects I'll encounter later on down the road.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

It's made me work on polishing them and heavily expanded my options on what I can do for them. With this class, I was able to figure out how to do different coding files being compatible with each other more fluidly, even if they aren't the exact same files.
